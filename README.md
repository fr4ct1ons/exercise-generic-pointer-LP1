# exercise-generic-pointer-LP1
Repository for a college project on generic pointers and function pointers.  

Subject: Programming Language I  
Teacher: Selan Rodrigues dos Santos  
Author: Gabriel Paes Landim de Lucena  

## About
For this project, we had to develop a GeneRic Array Algorithms Library, or simply a "graal".  
All code written by me.

## How to use
#### Testing
1. On the terminal, switch to the directory you extracted the files at.  
2. Just type ./graal_client and that's it!  
Note: You may have to run the makefile in order for step 2 to work. To do so, just type "make" on the terminal. Your machine must have the g++ compiler installed.  

#### Using the library
Just link the graal.o file when you compile the program. If you want to edit the source code, just edit the graal.h and graal.cpp files at will.

## Files and directory structure
include/ - Header files  
source/ - Source .cpp files  
driver/ - Test program to use with the library  
graal_client - Compiled program, to be ran on Linux.  
Makefile - A simple makefile to quickly compile the program.
